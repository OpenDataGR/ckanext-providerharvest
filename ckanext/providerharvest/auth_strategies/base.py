"""Pluggable auth strategies for the generic HTTP(S) transport.

An AuthStrategy's only job is to take an outgoing request's kwargs (as
passed to ``requests``) and a resolved :class:`SecretBundle`, and return
request kwargs with auth applied -- it never sees the raw secret_ref, and
callers must not log the returned kwargs (they now contain the credential).
